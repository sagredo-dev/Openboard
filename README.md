# Openboard
A patch I made to get OpenBoard to run in a window so that it can be used successfully with google-meet as well.

The slackbuild from Willy Sudiarto is included.

This patch has been merged into OpenBoard 1.6.4: https://github.com/OpenBoard-org/OpenBoard/commit/2f140067f18f77b6041e4807d5fbe180fabd8584
